      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Mitr Foundation is a registered charitable trust founded in 2004 by a group of committed friends driven by a shared passion to create a fairer and more compassionate society. True to its name, “Mitr”—meaning friend—the Foundation stands as a trusted ally to the underprivileged. It is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the education of school-going children living in urban slum areas of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

      <p class="text-lg">
        Our vision is to bring about meaningful and lasting change in the lives of children who deserve opportunities equal to their peers. We firmly believe that investing in the education of underprivileged children is one of the most powerful ways to transform society. Our commitment is to provide these children with access to formal education in a nurturing environment that builds self-confidence and opens doors to developmental opportunities enjoyed by mainstream students.
